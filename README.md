Project Proposal

For our data, we selected Track and Field data from the Olympic games over the last century. We’re going to take our data and import it into Postgres, SqlAlchemy, draw various insights from our data such as how many the number of medals each country has won, a comparison of how the Gold Medal time of select events has decreased over time, and Comparison of USA Gold medal count since 1896 per Olympics has increased or decreased. We’re going to save the data as a csv. Then we’re going to use D3 to take the data and put it on awebsite, with the Data with filters. We are also going to have 3 pages of plots from the insights we drew earlier and also a dropdown menu for each page to be able to navigate from the site. The data we’re using is 2395 rows. 

The data set contains various fields such as
Gender
